                    Recruiting agencies participate in sham interviews in order to sell human beings as commodities. If you have ever spoken to a
                    recruiter, then had an "interview" the next day, you have participated in this process. The purpose of this sham interview is to
                    make sure you are a sellable commodity (you are presentable, personable, etc).
                </li>
                <li class="commitments-list-item base-text">
                    Once you participate in the sham interview, the recruiting agency will scrub your resume of any contact information and then
                    proceed to "market" your skills to every company who might be interested in hiring someone like you. It sounds good until you
                    realize three things:
                    <ol class="numeric-list">
                        <li>
                            The company must be willing to pay an astronomical fee to the recruiting agency to hire you (industry standard is 2025%
                            of your first years' salary).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If a company cannot pay the fee, but likes your skill set, your recruiter is generally not allowed to disclose this to you
                            per their company policies. They have one job: to turn your skill set into a fee.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If a company is interested in both interviewing you and paying the astronomical fee associated with your hire, the
                            recruiting agency will do everything they can to source and provide the company with other candidates like you or
                            better than you. The company does not care if you get the job or if it's someone else. They want the fee and nobody
                            wants to bet on one horse.
                            If you have a very niche or in-demand
                            skill set, the practice of marketing your resume can turn into a new job for
                            you. If you are just a normal jobseeker
                            needing assistance, contacting a recruiting agency is not your best option.
                        </li>
