                    Ingrid Johnson, a single mom and former agency
                    recruiter. Ingrid's dream was to create a
                    company that both offered a radical improvement
                    in worklife
                    balance and funneled the vast
                    majority of profits back into the hands of the
                    employees. This mission, along with her
                    experience in the recruiting agency world, guided
                    her to create a revolutionary business model
                    within the Talent Acquisition market. Ingrid
                    identified several areas in need of improvement
                    including client fee percentages, recruiter
                    commission structure, and job candidate
                    attraction and retention. She also found great
                    need for transparency and integrity throughout
                    the recruiting, hiring and retention cycles. Talent
                    Savant was born. This ProHuman,

                    organization operates based on Ingrid's
                    four guiding principles of Transparency, Integrity,
                    Partnership and Speed.
